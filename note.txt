Stack Data Structure

Last in First out

There are some basic operations that allow us to perform different actions on a stack.
Push: Add an element to the top of a stack
Pop: Remove an element from the top of a stack
IsEmpty: Check if the stack is empty
IsFull: Check if the stack is full
Peek: Get the value of the top element without removing it
Search : Just search


Stack of Number
Stack of String

Implementing Stack Data Structure using Primitive Data are pretty straight forward.

But Non-Primitive Data are complex to use in Stack Data Structure.
It results in nested data inside nested data structure.

I learned Stack of Number and Stack of String.
But there is not much luck in implementing Stack with Array for today.
